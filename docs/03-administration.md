# 3. Administration

This section is dedicated to the administration and day-to-day management of your DJ Brain instance. Most administrative tasks are planned to be handled through a dedicated web-based Admin Dashboard.

**Note:** The Admin Dashboard and its related features are part of the long-term project roadmap (Phase 3) and are not yet implemented in the current version. This document describes the planned functionality.

## The Admin Dashboard (Future Feature)

The Admin Dashboard will be a password-protected area of the web interface accessible only to the system operator. Its goal is to provide a central location for managing the jukebox, viewing its status, and customizing its behavior.

### Planned Features:

#### 1. **Request and Playback History**
   - View a complete log of all requested songs.
   - See which user requested each track.
   - Review the AI's filler track selections.
   - Basic analytics, such as most-requested songs or artists.

#### 2. **User Management**
   - View a list of all users who have interacted with the jukebox.
   - Implement cooldowns to prevent a single user from spamming the request queue.
   - Ability to ban a user if necessary.

#### 3. **Queue Management**
   - Manually remove a track from the request queue.
   - "Pin" a track to the top of the queue.
   - Clear the entire request queue.

#### 4. **AI Brain Configuration**
   - Adjust the "liveliness" of the AI DJ (e.g., how often it picks filler tracks vs. user requests).
   - Manage "do not play" lists to prevent certain songs or artists from being played.

## Theming (Future Feature)

The ability to customize the look and feel of the DJ Brain frontend is a planned feature. The goal is to allow operators to easily change the visual theme to match their venue or event.

Examples of themes could include:
- A "Neon" theme for a modern bar.
- A "Retro" theme for a classic feel.
- Seasonal themes (e.g., "Holiday," "Summer").

Theming will likely be managed through the Admin Dashboard, allowing for easy selection between pre-built themes.

As these features are developed, this guide will be updated with detailed instructions on how to use them.
